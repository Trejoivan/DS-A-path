# Array Of Products

- Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array of the same lengthe, where each element in the output array is equal to the product of every other number in the input array. 

- in other words, the value of output[i] is equal to the product of every number in the input array other than input[i].

- Note that you're expected to solve the problem without using division

- EX: Input
```
array = [5, 1, 4, 2]
```
- EX: Output
``` 
[8, 40, 10, 20]
```
