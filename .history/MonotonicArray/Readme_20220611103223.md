Writa function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic

An array is monotonic if its elements are increasing or decreasing from left to right consistently. 

Non-increasing values are still valid ex : 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1    

Note that empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic
