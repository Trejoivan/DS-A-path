# Spiral Travers 

write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in Spiral order.

Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, and processd in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited. The

- EX: Input
```
 array = [
  [1,   2,   3,   4],
  [12,  13,  14,  5],
  [11,  16,  15,  6],
  [10,  9,   8,   7]
]
```

- EX: Output
```
