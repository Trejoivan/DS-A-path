Given two lists of integers, list1 and list2, and a parameter K, remove the minimum number of elements from list2 so that the K-window of the result will have no elements in common with the K-window of list1.


Define the K-window of a list to be the set of values of its first K elements. E.g., for the list [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5], the 1-window is the set {1}, the 2-window is the set {1, 2}, and the 3 window is the set {1, 2} (duplicate 1).
