
- Create a tool that can register and resolve. These tow functions will take an input like 
```
%XY%hello%AB%bye
```
and return a string as 
```
123hello456bye
```
- As you can see, XY is associated with 123 and AB is associated with 456 in this case. The source can only be replaced by the target if the source is surrounded by % signs. EX. %XY% turns into 123
