# Linked List Constructions

- Below are a few "terms" I use that you should be familiar with in order to understand certain explanations

- Head = 'The beginning of a Linked List'
- Tail = 'The end of a Linked List'
- .pre/.next = 'given the current node .prev is the previous node. .next is the next node' 
- Doubly Linked List = a linked list connected going both ways [.next and .prev] on way
``` 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5```
``` 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 <- 5```

- Singly Linked List =  a linked list connected going only on way

``` 1-> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5```
