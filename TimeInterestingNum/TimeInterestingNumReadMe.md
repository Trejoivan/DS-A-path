# Interesting Numbers 

 With times stored in the format "HH:MM:SS", find the number of "interesting" times that can be displayed between two given times S and T (inclusive).

 An "interesting" time is one that can be displayed with at most 2 characters.

 For example S "15:15:11" and T "15:15:15" would return the count of 1 as the only "interesting" time between S and T (inclusive) is "15:15:11".

 Another example, S "22:22:21" and T "22:22:23" would return the count of 3 because of the following times: "22:22:21", "22:22:22", "22:22:23"

 Constraints:

 S <= T
 00 <= HH <= 23
 00 <= MM <= 59
 00 <= SS <= 59
